# Improving Southwest Airlines Customer Service Operations with Text Analytics and Classification
## Background

As a Business Analytics student, I have always been interested in using data to solve real-world problems, and my background in crisis management drew me to this customer service project for Southwest Airlines. Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in data collection, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques. I am excited to share my work with others.

## Problem Statement:
Southwest Airline received a large volume of customer inquiries on Twitter when their system was broken down in December 2022. This has led to a poor customer experience and loss of business. The focus of this project is to build a classification model that can automatically classify customer inquiries on Twitter, which will help to improve the efficiency of Southwest Airline's customer service operations. 
For example, if a customer is asking for refund on twitter to Southwest Airline's, Southwest Airlinesâ€™ Social Media team would manually read the tweet and replied to navigate the customer to send DM. Our goal is to automate this process and send the case to a dedicated customer service team that is specialised in refund policy, which improves the efficieny of the escalation process.

## Dataset & Text Preprocessing
As part of this project, I scraped a dataset of 2500 customer service tweets directed at Southwest Airlines using the Twitter API. I then labeled each tweet based on the inquiry topic, such as refunds, flight changes, and no response needed, and created a pandas dataframe based on the labelled dataset. I then performed text preprocessing on the "text" column, which involved tokenizing, stemming, and removing stop words.

## Model Building
Using this preprocessed dataset, I built several machine learning models to classify customer service tickets based on their inquiry topic. I experimented with Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks, and evaluated the performance of each model using accuracy score. 

Of all the models I trained, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier performed the best, achieving an accuracy score of 0.858. This means that the SVM correctly predicted the inquiry topic of 85.8% of the customer service tickets in the test set. I used the "linear" kernel with regularization strength (C) equal to 1 and "gamma" set to "scale" for SVM.

Through this project, I learned how to use popular machine learning libraries in Python, such as scikit-learn and pandas, and gained valuable experience in text preprocessing techniques and model selection. 

Overall, this project has been a great learning experience for me, and I am excited to continue exploring the field of text analytics and machine learning.  I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
