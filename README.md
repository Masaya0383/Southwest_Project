Improving Southwest Airlines Customer Service Operations with Text Analytics and Classification


My name is Masaya, and I am a Business Analytics master's student at Fordham University. I have always been interested in using data to solve real-world problems, which is what drew me to this customer service project for Southwest Airlines. Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in data collection, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques, and I am excited to share my findings with others.

As part of this project, I scraped a dataset of 2500 customer service tweets directed at Southwest Airlines using the Twitter API. I then labeled each tweet based on the inquiry topic, such as refunds, flight changes, and no response needed, and created a pandas dataframe based on the labelled dataset. I then performed text preprocessing on the "text" column, which involved tokenizing, stemming, and removing stop words.

Using this preprocessed dataset, I built several machine learning models to classify customer service tickets based on their inquiry topic. I experimented with Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks, and evaluated the performance of each model using accuracy score.

Through this project, I learned how to use popular machine learning libraries in Python, such as scikit-learn and pandas, and gained valuable experience in text preprocessing techniques and model selection. I also learned how to visualize decision trees, feature importance, and confusion matrices, which helped me gain insights into how the models were making predictions.

Overall, this project has been a great learning experience for me, and I am excited to continue exploring the field of data science and machine learning. I hope that my work on this project can be helpful to others who are interested in using data to solve real-world problems, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
